    that overcome limitations of existing R packages. Includes hurdle models
    with arbitrary thresholds, extended Heckman selection models, flexible
    regression discontinuity designs, unified IV/GMM estimation, robust
    difference-in-differences for staggered adoption, Tobit types I-V,
    nonlinear panel models, and endogenous switching regressions.
